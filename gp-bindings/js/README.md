## Development

Run and build the project as you would run all other subcrates in this repo. Instructions are [here](../../DEVELOPMENT.md).

At this moment, play with the `test_zone` function to try different grids and functions, and run cargo test if you want to see your changes.

The deployment of the bindings into the GeoPlegma-js are done that repo.
