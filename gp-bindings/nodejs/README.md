# tsdown-starter

A starter for creating a TypeScript package.

## Development

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

- Build the library:

```bash
npm run build
```
This script will build and copy the index.node and index.d.ts files into `dist`. This folder will be used in the npm library as source code files.


NOTE: Eventually a github job will be added for this statement workflow.
